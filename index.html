          This is the bit where you talk about how unique you are as
             a business and that you're different to all of your competitors.
        Your Website looks the same though.

            You could have four columns here but you won't. You'll have three,

        <h2>Three</h2>

          Have a cog icon above one of these columns if you're really feeling
          especially creative.

        <h2>Columns</h2>
        <p>
          The perfect place to talk about your services. Because
          co-incidentally, you have three of them.
